# About Timey

Timey is a time management and reporting tool to help you organize, optimize and analyze tasks to help increase your effectiveness. Simply put, Timey lets you create work items (e.g. "Write Report", "Client X" or "Backend Development"), and track how much time you spend working on these items. The tracked time can then be summarized in a report and shared with your clients and colleagues or used by yourself to get an overview of your work efforts.
